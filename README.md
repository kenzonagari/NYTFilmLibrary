# NYT Film Review Library

## User Experience

As a user, I'd like to:

1. Search for a specific movie based on its title
2. Browse for different films through the decades
3. Add movies to favorites

Additionally, it'll be nice to have:

1. A light/dark theme option.
2. Search for a specific movie in each decade?
3. Access the iconic NYT critics' pick.
