# NYT Film Review Library

## Motivation

The goal is to learn React.js by building a website based on something that I'm passionate about - movies! The NYT Film Review 

## User Experience

As a user, I'd like to:

1. Search for a specific movie based on its title (Y)
2. Browse for different films through the decades (Y)
3. Add movies to favorites (WIP

Additionally, it'll be nice to have:

1. A light/dark theme option. (WIP)
2. Search for a specific movie in each decade? (WIP)
3. Access the iconic NYT critics' pick. (Y)
4. NYT API only shows up to 20 reviews at a time. Would be nice to access review #21 to #40, #41 to #60 .etc. (WIP)
